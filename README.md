# Ultra Marathon Race Data Analysis üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This beginner's project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset of ultra marathon races using Python and its libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. After running a marathon myself, I got inspired to dig deeper into race data and decided to embark on this project. The aim is to practice data analysis and visualization techniques while gaining insights into race and athlete performance. üìä

## Project Overview

This project examines various aspects of ultra marathon race data, such as:
- Race length distribution
- Average speed comparisons by gender
- Best and worst age groups for 50-mile races
- Seasonal differences in athlete performance

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle: The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633).

## Key Features of the Project

1. **Data Importing and Preparation**:
   - Load the dataset and prepare it for analysis by handling missing values and duplicate records.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Provide summary statistics and visual insights into the data.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Histograms, violin plots, and line plots are used to represent various relationships in the data.

4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Analyze performance differences between male and female athletes for 50 Km and 50 Mi races.
   - Identify the best and worst-performing age groups for 50mi races.

5. **Seasonal Performance**:
   - Investigate if athletes perform differently depending on the season.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Conclusion

This project provided me with an opportunity to practice basic data analysis skills and develop a deeper understanding of athlete performance trends in ultra marathons. As a beginner's project, it helped me improve my Python skills and explore the world of data visualization.

## Future Enhancements

Some possible next steps could be:
- Expanding the analysis to include more race metrics.
- Implementing machine learning models to predict performance outcomes based on demographic or race-specific features.
